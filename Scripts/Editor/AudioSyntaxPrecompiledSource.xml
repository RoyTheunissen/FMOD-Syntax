            <summary>
            Defines useful constants for menu paths so that we don't redefine those over and over.
            NOTE: These needed to be duplicated for the precompiled DLL, no avoiding it.

        <member name="T:RoyTheunissen.AudioSyntax.MigrationVersion">
            <summary>
            Responsible for managing the version of the system, which is stored in a AudioSyntaxSettings scriptable object
            config but we do not want that type to be pre-compiled because then it would be a lot harder to modify / it
            would increase the complexity of the package a bunch. So we have to jump through some hoops to get/set the
            version from that config because we cannot reference its type.

            initialize it with appropriate settings.

        <member name="T:RoyTheunissen.AudioSyntax.WizardBase">
            <summary>
            Base class for Wizards like the SetupWizard and MigrationWizard. Helps draw boxes with conditions that either
            fail or succeed depending on the current system status.
            
            Needs to be pre-compiled just because the MigrationWizard needs to be.
