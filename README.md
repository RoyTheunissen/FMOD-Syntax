## Getting Started

## Compatibility

This system was developed for Unity 2021 and upwards, it's recommended that you use it for this version.

If you use an older version of Unity and are running into trouble, feel free to reach out and I'll see what I can do.

## Installation

### Package Manager

Go to `Edit > Project Settings > Package Manager`. Under 'Scoped Registries' make sure there is an OpenUPM entry.

If you don't have one: click the `+` button and enter the following values:

- Name: `OpenUPM` <br />
- URL: `https://package.openupm.com` <br />

Then under 'Scope(s)' press the `+` button and add `com.roytheunissen`.

It should look something like this: <br />

<br />
All of my packages will now be available to you in the Package Manager in the 'My Registries' section and can be installed from there.
